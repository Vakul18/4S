Smart Safety, Security and Surveillance

Security & surveillance not only play a key role in ensuring the prosperity of citizens, but is also one of the prime concerns of any human being. 
A city’s development is dependent on the well-being of its inhabitants and it’s various sub-areas include (but not limited to) home security, 
medical emergency, city transport,
security of women & children, tourist support, SOS alert system, environmental stress warning system, mobile pollution monitors, structural alerts, 
disaster management, and accidental alerts systems.

Leverage the power of Microsoft Azure services to accelerate your ideas and make them go live to the security market worldwide and launch impactful 
and new generation security products that are secure and user-friendly.
We are interested in hearing about your next disruptive idea that not only focuses on safe and secure experiences but also brings together an ecosystem of enablers to make it a reality.
